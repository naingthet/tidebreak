//! A [`SandboxBackend`] over the Docker CLI: provision a local container, resolve
//! it to a loopback address, and tear it down idempotently, plus a correlation-tag
//! orphan sweep that reclaims containers whose provisioning intent has no live run.
//!
//! # Placement
//!
//! This lives in `tidebreak-server` rather than in `tidebreak-sandbox-protocol`: the
//! protocol crate deliberately defines only the wire types and their semantics and
//! carries no transport or process dependency, while this adapter shells out to the
//! `docker` CLI. The server already owns the durable provisioning intents this sweep
//! reconciles against, and already depends on the protocol crate.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This slice is the container *lifecycle* only. It stands a container up, publishes
//! its listener port to a loopback host port, and reports the reachable base URL.
//! The sandbox-agent wire transport that dials that URL — framing, the attach
//! handshake, the event stream — is a separate slice; nothing here speaks it.
//!
//! # The lifetime cap
//!
//! Docker has no TTL of its own, and a cap enforced by a host-side timer is worth
//! nothing in the case that matters: the host process dying is exactly what strands
//! a container, and a timer dies with it. So the cap is delivered *into* the
//! container — [`LIFETIME_CAP_ENV`] — and the sandbox agent exits when it elapses.
//! The agent is the init's only child, so its exit is the container's exit: the
//! container stops on its own whether or not any host is still alive to ask.
//!
//! This is an *absolute* cap, not an idle timeout: it bounds how long a container
//! may exist, not how long it may be quiet. The two are different guarantees and
//! only the absolute one is enforceable without the host participating — an idle
//! watchdog needs a keepalive from the attached host to distinguish a slow exec
//! from an abandoned run, and that keepalive does not exist on the transport yet.
//! The orphan sweep remains the reclaimer for a *live* host that lost track of a
//! container; the cap is what covers a host that is gone.
//!
//! # Detected capability
//!
//! The container runtime is a detected capability, exactly as Seatbelt is for local
//! code execution: [`DockerSandboxBackend::is_available`] reports whether the runtime
//! binary is resolvable, and the host consults it before choosing this backend. When
//! the binary is absent the trait methods fail with a normalized [`BackendError`]
//! rather than panicking — the runtime is never a hard dependency. A Docker-CLI
//! compatible runtime such as `podman` works through the same code path by pointing
//! [`DockerConfig::binary`] at it.
//!
//! # Container hardening
//!
//! In-container execution is the containment, so the container's own confinement
//! is the security control and not a detail of packaging. Every provisioning runs
//! the image as an unprivileged user, with every Linux capability dropped,
//! privilege escalation refused, a read-only root filesystem, and ceilings on
//! memory and process count. See [`SandboxHardening`] for what each of those buys
//! and where the writable surface is.
//!
//! # Egress enforcement
//!
//! Egress is enforced by network topology, not by anything inside the sandbox
//! container (whose `--cap-drop ALL` profile stays intact). Each provisioning
//! creates an *internal* Docker network — no route out — as the sandbox
//! container's only network, and stands up a second container from the same
//! image running the agent binary's `egress-proxy` mode. Only the proxy is
//! dual-homed: created on the default bridge (outbound reach plus a
//! loopback-published host port) and then connected onto the internal network
//! under the [`EGRESS_PROXY_ALIAS`] name. The sandbox's `HTTP(S)_PROXY`
//! environment points compliant tools at the proxy; a command that ignores it
//! has no route anywhere.
//!
//! The proxy enforces the run's compiled [`SandboxNetworkPolicy`] (deny by
//! default, delivered as JSON in its environment) with the same CONNECT-only
//! contract as the native local adapter's loopback broker, and it also carries
//! the host-to-agent transport: a port published on a container whose only
//! network is internal is not reachable from the host, so the proxy's published
//! port TCP-relays to the sandbox's supervisor across the internal network and
//! [`address`](SandboxBackend::address) resolves the proxy's port. The per-run
//! transport secret still gates attach.
//!
//! The sandbox never needs external DNS: CONNECT carries the destination
//! *name* and the proxy resolves it outside the sandbox. So the sandbox
//! container's DNS upstream is pointed at a blackhole ([`SANDBOX_DNS_SINK`])
//! — the embedded resolver still answers the internal network's own names
//! (the proxy alias) authoritatively, but an external lookup has nowhere to
//! go. On engines new enough to not forward external lookups from internal
//! networks the flag is redundant; on older engines that do forward, it turns
//! the name-lookup side channel into a query addressed to an unroutable
//! documentation prefix. Residual: on those older engines the query packet
//! still *leaves* the host toward that prefix before being dropped unanswered,
//! so an observer on the local segment could see looked-up names; payload
//! connections stay blocked either way.
//!
//! # Image verification
//!
//! The default image ref is the published documents-variant agent image pinned
//! **by digest** ([`PUBLISHED_IMAGE_DIGEST`]): a `repository@sha256:…` ref is
//! content-addressed, so the daemon resolves it to exactly those bytes or fails
//! the provisioning — repointing the tag on the registry changes nothing, and a
//! locally present image of another content cannot answer for it. That is the
//! fail-closed digest check issue #1188 asked for, enforced at resolution
//! rather than re-derived after the fact.
//!
//! A ref *without* a digest — the local development fallback while no pin is
//! recorded, or an operator override that names a mutable tag — is used
//! verbatim and stays unverified: the daemon resolves the tag at provisioning
//! time with no host-side integrity check. The backend reports which case it is
//! in through [`SandboxBackend::verifies_image_integrity`], so detached
//! admission and the settings surface treat an unpinned image as the unmet
//! precondition it is, and startup logs the unverified case.
//!
//! # The transport secret
//!
//! [`SandboxAddress`] bundles a per-run [`TransportSecret`]. The design has the host
//! mint that secret and deliver it through the provider's control plane, but the
//! provisioning path does not carry it yet, so this adapter mints it at
//! [`provision`](SandboxBackend::provision), injects it into the container's
//! environment (the local control plane is Docker itself), and recovers it in
//! [`address`](SandboxBackend::address). This keeps `address` a pure function of the
//! handle — it survives a host restart, because everything it needs lives in Docker's
//! own state — and the host-minted delivery wiring is a later slice's concern.
