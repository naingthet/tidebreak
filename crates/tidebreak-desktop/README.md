# tidebreak-desktop

Tauri shell for Tidebreak. On launch it binds `tidebreak-server` to an ephemeral
loopback port, mints a per-launch bearer token, and hosts the React chat UI in a
webview. The UI talks to that local API over HTTP + WebSocket (subprotocol auth).
The native host also owns the folder picker and a private host-broker sidecar;
the renderer receives opaque folder IDs and display names, never absolute paths.

The Documents surface derives its corpus from the authoritative current chat:
project chats use that project's documents and loose chats use the unscoped
corpus. A native file picker
accepts text and Markdown files, opens the selected regular file once without
following a final symlink, applies the upload bound to the open handle, and sends
the bytes directly to the in-process API. The webview receives only a safe
catalog/search projection: bounded display titles, processing states, and plain
passages. Source paths, bytes, index metadata, and generation identities remain
native/server-side.
Canonical document routes also require the native executor credential in this
embedding, so the renderer's ordinary bearer cannot bypass that projection.

When an agent needs a folder outside the current context, the chat UI renders a
bounded consent card from the local API's authoritative pending-work list. The
user can decline or ask the native host to open a picker. Native code then owns
the fenced claim, broker registration, and durable recovery receipt. A broker
mutation is marked durably before its single bounded dispatch and is never
replayed after an ambiguous response. Background and restart recovery only query
its exact operation receipt and publish a known result. Native mutation routes
require a second credential that is never exposed to the webview. Closing the
picker is a normal decline, and paths remain confined to app-private native state.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml` at the repo root)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)
- [Tauri CLI 2](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/):
  `cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"`
- Platform WebView deps (macOS: Xcode CLT; Linux: WebKitGTK — see Tauri docs)

## Run locally (native window)

From anywhere in the repo:

```sh
scripts/dev.sh
```

That installs the UI dependencies and opens the window. Arguments are forwarded
to `cargo tauri dev`. The long way, from this directory, is the same two steps:

```sh
pnpm --dir ui install
cargo tauri dev
```

That starts Vite on `http://localhost:1420` and opens the Tidebreak window. The
Rust host boots the in-process API; the webview calls `server_info` to learn the
base URL and token. The Tauri pre-dev command builds and stages the broker
sidecar for the current target automatically.

Debug builds run under the identifier `io.github.naingthet.tidebreak.dev`
(instead of `io.github.naingthet.tidebreak`), so `cargo tauri dev` keeps its own
single-instance lock and app-data directory and can run alongside an installed
release build. Packaged staging builds use `io.github.naingthet.tidebreak.staging`
and a blue icon for the same reason: staging, debug, and production do not share
state.

Builds before the identity changed ran as `io.brightwave.tidebreak` (and
`.dev`, `.staging`). At launch, before it opens anything, the app moves that
identity's data folder, webview storage, and keychain item to its own, so the
first dev run after the change carries the old dev profile across. See
[decision 103](../../docs/decisions/0103-tidebreak-runs-under-its-own-app-identity.md).

Create an installable bundle. The before-build hook compiles the target-specific
broker and the default Tauri configuration includes it automatically:

```sh
cargo tauri build
```

For the release-shaped universal macOS bundle, install both Rust targets and
select Tauri's synthetic universal target. The hook stages one broker per slice
and combines those brokers with `lipo`; Tauri combines the app executable:

```sh
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo tauri build --target universal-apple-darwin
```

## Run locally (browser UI against `tidebreak serve`)

Useful when iterating on the React UI without rebuilding the native shell.

```sh
# terminal 1 — from the repo root. TIDEBREAK_DATA_DIR keeps this profile in
# the repo's ignored .tidebreak folder; leave it out to serve the dev app's own
# data while the dev app is closed.
TIDEBREAK_DATA_DIR=.tidebreak cargo run -p tidebreak-cli -- serve
# note the printed URL and token

# terminal 2
cp ui/.env.example ui/.env.local
# edit ui/.env.local: VITE_TIDEBREAK_URL and VITE_TIDEBREAK_TOKEN

pnpm --dir ui install
pnpm --dir ui dev
# open http://localhost:1420
```

`.env.local` is gitignored (Vite convention).

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/` | Tauri host (server boot, sidecar lifecycle, native folder consent) |
| `ui/` | React + Vite frontend |
| `scripts/` | Cross-platform sidecar staging for Tauri dev/build |
| `binaries/` | Generated target-specific sidecar (gitignored) |
| `tauri.conf.json` | Window, CSP, sidecar bundle, and build commands |
| `icons/` | App icons (generated from the brand mark) |
| `capabilities/` | Tauri ACL (loopback remote URLs for the local API) |
