//! The chat event socket's wire contract, as a Rust client reads it.
//!
//! The desktop renderer decodes the server's JSON through TypeScript generated
//! from these same definitions (see `docs/wire-types.md`). The CLI used to keep
//! a third, hand-written mirror of the frame shapes, and nothing tied that
//! mirror to the server: a field renamed here compiled, shipped, and failed at
//! runtime. This module is the one place a Rust client imports the socket's
//! types from, so a rename is a compile error in the CLI the way it is a type
//! error in the renderer.
//!
//! # Reading tolerantly
//!
//! A client can be a release behind the server it attaches to, so these types
//! read the way such a client has to:
//!
//! - Unknown keys are ignored at every level. A newer server can add a field
//!   without breaking an older client. None of the types a client reads here
//!   declares `deny_unknown_fields`; request bodies the server reads still do.
//! - Every vocabulary is closed. Tool names, approval kinds, tool statuses,
//!   and grant rungs are the server's own enums, so a value outside them
//!   fails to decode rather than folding to a string. Turn failure
//!   categories are the one open vocabulary: a category this build does not
//!   know reads as `unknown`, an engine it does not know on a failure reads
//!   as absent, and the CLI reads a `turn_failed` it cannot decode at all as
//!   a failure of unknown cause, because a follower that skipped it would
//!   wait on the turn forever.
//! - An event type the client does not know fails its frame. The CLI skips
//!   that frame, counts it, and says so on stderr, and it moves its cursor
//!   past the frame so a reconnect does not replay it.
//!
//! Strictness lives in the tests instead. The fixtures below are serialized
//! from these same types, and every test that reads them decodes each entry
//! and serializes it back. A key the type does not declare drops out of that
//! round trip and fails it, so drift between the server and a reader still
//! fails a test without failing a user one release behind.
//!
//! A change a tolerant reader cannot absorb, such as a removed or renamed
//! field, raises [`API_LEVEL`]. The version handshake then turns the gap into
//! an "update Tidebreak" message instead of a decode error.
//!
//! # Version
//!
//! [`ServerVersion`] is what `GET /version` answers, and what `/healthz` and
//! `/auth/discovery` carry beside their own keys. [`compatibility`] compares
//! it with [`MIN_API_LEVEL`] through [`API_LEVEL`], the range a client built
//! from this source reads.
//!
//! # REST records
//!
//! The records the CLI reads over HTTP — the model catalog, the provider
//! list, the MCP server listing, agent runs, and conversation outputs — are
//! the same response types the routes serialize, re-exported below. They read
//! the same way as the frames, [`CustomModelConfig`] included: a provider row
//! reads tolerantly, and only the provider update body checks a row's keys
//! strictly when the server saves it. The fixtures in
//! `fixtures/rest-records.json` hold one real value per record, serialized by
//! the generator test in `wire_types.rs`, and the CLI decodes every entry.
//!
//! # Code mode
//!
//! The same module carries the code-mode surface the CLI drives: repo,
//! workspace, session, turn, approval, and delivery snapshots, the sequenced
//! event frame on `/sessions/{id}/events`, and the notices on
//! `/updates`. They read the same way. The one shape a client composes itself
//! is the response to `POST /sessions/{id}/turns`, which is a
//! [`TurnSnapshot`] or [`QueuedTurn`], both on `202`. The two share no
//! required field, so a snapshot cannot decode as the other.
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! [`limits`] holds the guard sizes the renderer applies to opaque strings on
//! this surface. They are generated into `wire.ts` from here, so the two
//! clients cannot disagree about how long an id, a timestamp, or a cursor may
//! be.
