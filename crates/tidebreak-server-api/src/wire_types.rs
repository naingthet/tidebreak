//! Generation of the desktop's TypeScript wire types from these Rust
//! definitions.
//!
//! The renderer used to describe the server's JSON in hand-written TypeScript.
//! Nothing connected the two, so both sides could be green over a broken
//! contract — and twice were, both times on optionality.
//!
//! Everything here is test-only. The generator is a test so that the checked-in
//! output is verified by the same command that produces it: run normally it
//! compares and fails on a diff, and CI therefore fails on a stale file. The
