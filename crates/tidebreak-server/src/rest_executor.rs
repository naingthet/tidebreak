//! Governed REST executor: perform one declared operation against a
//! `rest_api` connected app on behalf of a caller.
//!
//! The executor is the only code that turns a caller's operation request into
//! bytes on the wire, and every guarantee it makes is server-side and
//! fail-closed:
//!
//! - The request is validated against the ingested
//!   [`OperationCatalog`](crate::openapi_catalog::OperationCatalog) *before any
//!   I/O* — an undeclared operation, an undeclared parameter, a missing
//!   required parameter, or a value outside its declared schema refuses the
//!   request outright. The catalog, not the caller, decides what is
//!   executable.
//! - Egress mirrors the native web-search fetcher's posture: the base URL is
//!   admitted (https, or plain HTTP only to an explicit loopback IP literal
//!   after opt-in), no userinfo, no fragment, the host's DNS answer is
//!   resolved and vetted per request with the same denied-network list, the
//!   connection is pinned to exactly the vetted addresses, redirects are never
//!   followed, and request and response byte counts and wall time are capped.
//!   Unlike the web-search policy, an explicit port is allowed — a REST base
//!   URL may legitimately pin one — and refusals distinguish an unresolvable
//!   host from a denied address, because the base URL is operator
//!   configuration rather than a model-chosen name; resolved addresses are
//!   still never echoed.
//! - The credential is a *reference* into the profile secret store. Its value
//!   is resolved only here, at request time, injected as a header, and never
//!   appears in `Debug` output, error text, or logs — the transport request's
//!   `Debug` impl redacts every header value, and transport failures are
//!   stripped of URLs before their message is kept.
//!
//! Response bounds are sized for interactive UIs, not model context windows —
//! deliberately larger than the MCP tool-result clamp — per the connected-apps
//! design (`docs/connected-apps.md`).
//!
//! This slice is standalone: inputs are plain values ([`RestApiTarget`],
//! [`RestOperationRequest`]); wiring to the connected-app record arrives in
//! later slices.
