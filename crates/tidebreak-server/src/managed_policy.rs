//! Managed-mode policy: whether this profile is provisioned by a model
//! gateway, and on whose authority.
//!
//! Policy and session are separate layers with separate lifecycles: the
//! gateway session (keychain) comes and goes with sign-in, while the policy
//! (this module) persists across restarts and sign-out. Resolution honors a
//! fixed precedence — an OS-managed source (MDM) over sticky provisioned
//! state over the open default — so a device-management assertion can never
//! be shadowed by local state.
//!
//! The provisioned tier lives in a sidecar file, `{data_dir}/gateway-policy.json`
//! ([`ProvisionedPolicyFile`]), not in the SQLite settings table: the schema
//! lifecycle ([`crate::desktop_schema`]) moves a database it cannot carry
//! forward into a backup folder, and policy stored there would leave with it —
//! resolving the profile unmanaged and orphaning the gateway session the
//! policy had authorized. Sidecar files stay put, so the policy does too.
//!
//! Nothing here changes behavior yet. Lockdown of the BYOK and MCP write
//! paths, the settings surfaces, and the sign-in gate all read this policy
//! in follow-up slices. The provisioning write path is crate-internal by
//! design: its only intended callers are the deep-link pairing flow and
//! tests — it is deliberately not reachable from any renderer-writable
//! route, which is what makes the state sticky rather than a setting.
