//! Re-home stored credentials so the running binary owns their keychain item.
//!
//! Every credential this profile stores lives in one item — see
//! [`BundledSecretProvider`] for why. This pass does two things to it: it
//! rewrites that item so the running binary owns it, and it sweeps up any
//! per-key items left behind by a build that predates the bundle, moving each
//! value in and removing the old item.
//!
//! macOS grants keychain access on the code signature of the process that
//! *created* an item. An item created by a binary carrying the dev designated
//! requirement (`identifier "tidebreak-dev" and certificate leaf = H"…"`) stays
//! readable after a rebuild and from a binary at another path. An item created
//! by some earlier build is a different matter: the access prompt returns, and
//! because the dev certificate is self-signed with no team identifier, the
//! approval given at that prompt is pinned to the binary's cdhash — the next
//! rebuild invalidates it. Credentials stored before a machine had a stable dev
//! identity therefore prompt once per credential on every launch, forever.
//!
//! Rewriting the value from a signed binary is the durable repair: delete the
//! item, then store the value again so the new item belongs to the current
//! signature. Read the value first and hold it in memory, so a failure to
//! delete leaves the credentials in place.
//!
//! Because there is one item, that repair now costs one approval rather than
//! one per credential — which is the whole reason the bundle exists.
//!
//! Two entry points run the pass. Server boot calls
//! [`rehome_once_per_binary`], which runs once per binary (an app update
//! always replaces the binary, so that is once per update) before any
//! credential consumer is constructed. And `tidebreak rehome-secrets` runs
//! [`rehome_secrets`] on demand — the manual repair for a dev machine whose
//! signing identity changed without a binary stamp change.
