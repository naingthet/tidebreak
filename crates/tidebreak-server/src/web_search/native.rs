//! Native page extraction: fetch one admitted URL and reduce the page to
//! bounded, readable text.
//!
//! The extractor follows redirects manually so that every hop — not just the
//! first URL — passes the full [`super::fetch_policy`] admission check with a
//! fresh DNS resolution, and each connection is pinned to the exact addresses
//! that were vetted. That re-vetting is the defense against DNS rebinding and
//! redirect-based server-side request forgery: a page may not launder a fetch
//! toward loopback, private, link-local, or metadata address space through a
//! redirect or a second DNS answer. Fetches carry no cookies, no proxy, and no
//! ambient credentials, announce a distinct honest user agent, and retain a
//! bounded body of an allow-listed textual content type only.
//!
//! One deadline covers the whole extraction — every DNS resolution, every hop,
//! and the parse — because the individually bounded steps multiply: a host that
//! black-holes its DNS answers can otherwise stall a caller for minutes out of
//! a single tool call.
//!
//! Extraction itself never returns junk to a caller: a page whose readable
//! content falls below a small word floor — including script-only shells that
//! ask the visitor to enable JavaScript — resolves the typed
//! [`NativeExtractError::NoReadableContent`] so a caller can distinguish
//! "extracted" from "nothing there". Adversarial markup is bounded *before* it
//! is serialized rather than after, and extracted text is stripped of the
//! control and bidirectional characters that let a page lie to a renderer.

<h1>Rust Ownership Explained</h1>
<p>Ownership is the discipline that lets Rust manage memory without a garbage
collector. Every value has a single owner, and when the owner goes out of
scope the value is dropped deterministically.</p>
<p>Borrowing lets other code read or mutate a value without taking ownership.
The compiler enforces that mutable borrows are exclusive, which rules out data
races at compile time rather than at runtime.</p>
<p>Lifetimes describe how long references remain valid. Most of the time the
compiler infers them, and explicit annotations only appear where the
relationships between references are ambiguous.</p>
