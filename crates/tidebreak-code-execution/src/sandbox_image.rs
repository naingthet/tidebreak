//! The published Tidebreak documents sandbox image, as one pin.
//!
//! Two backends in this crate run the same image: the Daytona adapter
//! registers it as a snapshot in the caller's organization, and the Docker
//! adapter runs it directly on the host's container runtime. Environment
//! parity across backends is the whole point of the image — LibreOffice, the
//! document skills' pinned Python dependencies, Node with the deck library,
//! and the bundled exec helper scripts — so the two must never drift onto
//! different digests.
//!
//! The pin is rewritten by the job in
//! `.github/workflows/publish-sandbox-image.yml` after every image publish,
//! alongside `PUBLISHED_IMAGE_DIGEST` in `tidebreak-sandbox-runtime`'s
//! `docker` module and the E2B template definition. That job matches on the
//! constant names below, so renaming one means editing the workflow in the
//! same change.
