# Slack adapter beside a standalone machine

Run the published Tidebreak server image, its PostgreSQL store, and the Slack
adapter against the same Compose project. This is an operator example, not a
hosted add-on. Put a TLS-terminating reverse proxy in front of both published
ports. Nothing here terminates TLS.

Read [self-hosting](../../../docs/self-hosting.md) for the machine itself and
the Slack section there for the app manifest, bootstrap bearer, service
principal, and workspace grant. Read [Slack sessions](../../../docs/slack-sessions.md)
for how the adapter behaves once it is up.

## What you run

- `tidebreak`: `ghcr.io/naingthet/tidebreak-server`, listening on container
  port 8080, published at `127.0.0.1:8080`.
- `postgres`: the machine's store.
- `slack-adapter`: the Slack adapter image that ships with Model Gateway
  (tags `v<version>`), listening on container port 8080, published at
  `127.0.0.1:8081`. Every tag is signed keyless with Sigstore; to verify a
  pull before you run it, check that the signature names the release
  workflow of the repository that published it:

  ```sh
  cosign verify <slack-adapter-image>:v<version> \
    --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/<owner>/<repository>/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@' \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
  ```
- `adapter-postgres`: the adapter's own store. The adapter is a shared,
  stateful service; do not point it at the machine's database.

The adapter needs no Model Gateway variables. Create a custom Slack app and
install it in your workspace; this setup uses one workspace's bot token and
requires no distributed OAuth app. Enable event subscriptions, slash commands,
and interactivity using the manifest in the self-hosting guide.

## Files you create

Copy the examples, then fill them. Keep secrets `0600` and out of git.

```sh
cd deploy/compose/slack
umask 077
cp .env.example .env
cp slack.env.example slack.env
cp machines.json.example machines.json
cp tokens.example tokens
```

1. **`.env`** — database passwords, blob store, provider key, public machine
   URL, image tags, the adapter bootstrap bearer, and the token-sealing key.
2. **`slack.env`** — `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`. The
   adapter receives events and slash commands over HTTPS request URLs; it
   does not use socket mode.
3. **`tokens`** — one person `admin` line and one `service` line. Channel
   sessions run as the service principal
   ([decision 0089](../../../docs/decisions/0089-service-principals.md)).
4. **`machines.json`** — the machine directory. `base_url` is the Compose
   service name (`http://tidebreak:8080`). `public_url` is the URL people open
   in a browser. `bootstrap_token` must match a value in
   `TIDEBREAK_ADAPTER_BOOTSTRAP_TOKENS`.

Generate tokens and the bootstrap bearer with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

## The machine directory: file or environment

This Compose file mounts `./machines.json` read-only and points
`SLACK_ADAPTER_MACHINES_FILE` at that path. Adapter images from gateway
release v0.1.0-alpha.195 read that file; set `SLACK_ADAPTER_MACHINES` to the
same JSON instead if you pin an older image.

To pass the same document as environment instead, drop the volume and set:

```text
SLACK_ADAPTER_MACHINES={"machines":{"standalone":{"kind":"standalone","base_url":"http://tidebreak:8080","public_url":"https://<your machine host>","bootstrap_token":"<the bearer>"}},"defaults":{"<Slack workspace id>":"standalone"}}
```

Do not set both unless the image you pin says that is valid.

## Start

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env up -d
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8081/health/setup
```

`GET /health/setup` on the adapter reports `ready` and `missing`. Fill
everything `missing` names before you invite the app into a workspace.

Point Slack event and slash-command request URLs at the adapter's public
origin, not at the machine. Point browsers at the machine's public origin for
the workspace grant approval.

After the workspace grant is approved, invite Tidebreak into a channel and
mention it with a task. A repository default is optional. Use the Configure link
to set channel behavior in Tidebreak. Shared GitHub App repository access applies
across connected channels, so you do not approve repositories per channel.

This Compose example does not provision a sandbox runtime. Repository-less
sessions therefore use Internal on the machine unless you add a runtime and
select its admitted harness. Gateway-hosted installations can provision that
runtime through Gateway's Slack setup page.
