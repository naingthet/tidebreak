/**
 * What authority this client asks a gateway for, and what a session got.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here.
 *
 * A gateway's authorization page refuses a scope it does not know rather than
 * ignoring it (`canonical_scope`, mg `cli_auth.rs`), and refuses control-plane
 * scopes outright from a client whose registration is not control-plane
 * capable. Either refusal breaks sign-in completely — not the console surface,
 * the whole pairing. So a scope is requested only from a gateway that
 * advertises it on `GET /api/v1/meta`, and the absence of an advertisement
 * always means "do not ask".
 *
 * The advertisement that matters is `surfaces.tidebreak_mobile_console`: this
 * installation's `tidebreak-mobile` client may hold the console resources.
 * `surfaces.control_plane_write` is *not*
 * a substitute — it is a binary-wide fact about the scope vocabulary, true on
 * gateways deployed today whose `tidebreak-mobile` client is still confined to
 * `control` + `tidebreak:*`. Gating on it alone would break sign-in against
 * every one of them.
