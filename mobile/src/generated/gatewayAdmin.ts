         *     Administrators only. Unlike the other reads here there is no per-caller view of it to narrow to — the ledger records actions taken across the whole installation, and a caller's own rows would be an account of themselves rather than of the gateway.
         *
         *     Narrow before paging. `action` matches by prefix, so `rate_limit.` returns everything that subsystem recorded and `rate_limit.exceeded` only that one action; `outcome` keeps only `succeeded`, `denied`, or `failed` rows; `target_type` and `target_id` name the object an event concerned, and every row carries both back so a lifecycle event can be joined to the thing it happened to. Action prefixes and target identity are indexed, so a subsystem-wide dashboard and a lookup for one object's lifecycle both narrow before paging.
         *
         *     `actor_id` asks the opposite question to `target_id`: it narrows to the actions an account *took*, where `target_id` narrows to the actions taken *against* one. Reading what one administrator changed is `actor_id`; reading what happened to one person's account is `target_type=user&target_id=…`. Pass `actor_type=user` beside `actor_id` — the ledger's actor index leads with the kind, so naming both keeps the lookup an index read.
         *
         *     `target_type` is one of `installation`, `session`, `api_token`, `identity_provider`, `user`, `team`, `model_provider`, `provider_model`, `provider_subscription_binding`, `connected_app`, `mcp_endpoint`, `scim_connector`, `sandbox`, `shared_app`, `connector_session`, `cost_limit_policy`, `rate_limit_policy`, `guardrail_policy`, `guardrail_finding`, `guardrail_engine`, or `add_on`.

Filters are part of the query, not the cursor — keep them identical across a paging run or the pages describe different ledgers.

         *     Which members of the body apply is decided by `kind`. `datadog` and `vercel` authenticate with a shared secret, while `sentry`, `linear`, `figma`, `slack`, `atlassian`, and `pagerduty` use each caller's own delegated grant, so `auth_method` is fixed for those native kinds and anything sent for it is ignored. `datadog` needs `credential.scheme` because it is what tells its two recipes apart. `sentry` defaults its endpoint, OAuth URLs, and scopes. `figma` defaults its endpoint, OAuth URLs, and scopes the same way, and authenticates at Figma's token endpoint with HTTP Basic. `pagerduty` defaults the same three and authenticates with `client_secret_post`; its endpoint may only be one of PagerDuty's two regional API origins, and its OAuth URLs are pinned to the one global identity service both regions use, so sending anything else for them is refused rather than stored. `vercel` defaults its endpoint to `https://api.vercel.com`, accepts no other origin, and injects `credential.shared_secret` as a bearer token. `datadog`, `sentry`, `figma`, `pagerduty`, and `vercel` carry OpenAPI documents that ship with the gateway. `linear` and `atlassian` fix their hosted MCP endpoints, perform OAuth discovery and dynamic client registration, and carry the compiled MCP transport catalog, so `rest_api.openapi_document` is read only for `rest_api`. `slack` fixes the hosted MCP endpoint and its authorize and token endpoints, and carries the same compiled catalog, but Slack offers no dynamic registration: send the client ID in `oauth` and the secret in `credential.oauth_client_secret`, both required, and leave the OAuth URLs out — a host other than Slack's own is refused. `gitlab` derives its OAuth endpoints from `endpoint_url` — `<base>/oauth/authorize` and `<base>/oauth/token`, keeping any path prefix a relative-URL install carries — and takes the client id and secret an administrator created on the instance. It declares the streaming git channel only, and its push credential is each caller's own grant, presented as `oauth2:<token>`.
         *
         *     The built-in app is refused with `built_in_app`. The gateway provisions that one itself at startup, with an origin and a document no request could supply. A reused name is `name_taken`, and a tool slug another governed REST app already exposes is `tool_slug_taken` — a slug is what an agent addresses a tool by, so two apps cannot share one.
         *
         *     `credential_required` means the app authenticates with a stored credential and none was sent; `conflicting_credentials` means a secret was sent that this app would not use — either a second recipe alongside the one it takes, or a lone secret an app that authenticates with nothing has no use for. It names the field to remove. Nothing sent here is ever silently dropped, so a `201` means every secret in the request was stored. `invalid_openapi` means the document could not be projected into callable tools.
         *
         *     `invalid_configuration` reports that a value, or its relation to the ones beside it, does not describe a usable app. It names the field to change, but the checks behind it are relations between fields — a credential placement the authentication method forbids, a delegated-OAuth app missing its client — so the named field is where to start rather than the whole of what is wrong.
         *
         *     A `git_forge` app carries `git_forge` instead of `rest_api`: git's protocol endpoints are declared in code, so there is no document to supply, and its ceilings bound a streamed packfile rather than a buffered body. A bound outside its range is refused rather than narrowed to fit. A basic-placement forge names its login convention in `credential.login` — `x_access_token`, `oauth2`, or `bot_user` — and supplies `credential.username` only for `bot_user`.
         *
         *     Excluded from self-administration. This operation can mint a `git_forge` app, which is a credentialed path that pushes code to a forge; a model editing the gateway through the built-in app must not be able to create the transport its own sandboxes then push through.

         *     Administrators list the installation; every other caller lists only their own conversations. There is no `user_id` filter: the scope is the caller's authority, so an administrator narrowing to one account reads that account's usage through `listUsage` instead.

         *     Costs are integer micro-US-dollars — 1 000 000 to the dollar. `estimated_cost_microusd` covers metered spend only and is a floor rather than a total wherever `priced_request_count` is below `inference_requests`; `getCostStateSummary` says why. `subscription_cost_microusd` is notional — what the traffic would have cost had a user's own subscription not absorbed it. `provisioned_cost_microusd` is the Standard-rate equivalent of traffic absorbed by provider-provisioned capacity. `credits_cost_microusd` is prepaid-credit draw-down.

Page with `next_cursor`: pass it back as `cursor` until the response returns null. The cursor is a keyset on `last_activity_at`, not an offset, so conversations that become active while paging do not shift the pages already read.

         * Create a cost limit
         * @description Creates one calendar-window spend cap over a scope. Limits are integer micro-US-dollars — 1 000 000 to the dollar — so a $50 monthly cap is `limit_microusd: 50000000`. A limit of `0` is a total denial of the scope's metered inference, not "unlimited"; to stop enforcing a cap without removing it, create or update it with `enabled: false`.
         *
         *     `scope_type` selects what `scope_id` names: an account id from `listPeople` for `user`, a team id from `listTeams` for `team`, a catalog model id from `listProviderModels` for `gateway_model`. The `installation` scope covers the whole gateway and takes no `scope_id` — send it null or omit it. `connected_app` is reserved: the vocabulary carries it because policy rows can hold it, but a create is refused until inference spend can be attributed to an app.
         *
         *     `applies_to` splits the traffic a cap sees: `all` covers every metered request in scope, `sandbox` covers only gateway-hosted sandbox spend. One policy exists per scope, `applies_to`, and `window`; a second create over the same three is refused with 409 naming the policy that already holds them, which is the one to change with `updateCostLimit`. Neither the scope nor the window can be re-targeted afterwards — `updateCostLimit` changes only the amount and the switch — so moving a cap means `deleteCostLimit` and a fresh create.
         *
         *     Spend is evaluated against the caller-independent window that `getCostControlSettings` names a time zone for, and the new policy's current state is returned with it: read `current_spend_microusd`, `exceeded`, and `resets_at` to see whether it bites immediately.
         *
         *     Every refusal names the rule that failed, so none of them is worth a blind retry: `scope_id_required` and `scope_id_not_allowed` for a scope and target that disagree, `unknown_scope_id` for a target no row answers to, `negative_cost_limit` for an amount below zero, `connected_app_attribution_unavailable` for the reserved scope, and `duplicate_cost_limit` — the 409 — for a tuple already covered.

Both fields are required and replace what is stored, so read the policy from `listCostLimits` before sending one.

Which fix is right — trimming an instruction file, dropping a cache breakpoint, moving to a smaller route — is a decision the gateway cannot make.
         *
         *     Findings are drawn per (client, route) subject over the window, because fixed context belongs to whoever assembles it while price and context window belong to the route. Three rules fire:
         *
         *     `oversized_fixed_context` — the subject's median opening-request preamble (standing instructions plus tool definitions) is at least twice the installation's own median and at least 20 KB. The comparison is against this installation rather than an absolute budget; `observed` and `baseline` are those two medians in bytes, and `impact_microusd` is the share of opening-request spend the excess accounts for.
         *
         *     `cache_writes_exceed_savings` — prompt-cache write premiums beat the read discounts they bought by more than one US dollar over the window. `observed` and `baseline` are the two halves of `cache_savings_microusd`, so this cannot disagree with the figure `listUsage` reports; it says which half won.
         *
         *     `low_context_utilization` — a route with a window of 200,000 tokens or more serves requests whose median input fills 15% of it or less. `impact_microusd` is null: the saving is the price difference against a smaller route, and choosing that route is a commercial judgment.
         *
         *     Every rule has a minimum sample — 20 opening requests for the preamble comparison, 50 committed requests for the other two — so a quiet subject produces nothing rather than noise. Rows that predate request-shape capture have null counts and drop out rather than counting as zero; `shape_recorded_requests` states that denominator beside `committed_requests`.
         *
         *     Findings are ranked by accounted spend, descending. A finding the gateway cannot price sorts after every priced one, then by request volume — unpriceable is not the same as small.
         *
         *     `since` and `until` are RFC3339; `since` is inclusive, `until` is exclusive, and `until` must be later than `since`. With neither, the window is the trailing 30 days, and the bounds applied are returned.

         *     `finish_reasons` reports the raw upstream terminal strings behind those states, verbatim, each beside the `terminal_state` it was classified as — the audit trail for reasons the mapping never anticipated. The reason is provider-controlled text, so rows are ordered by event count descending and capped; `finish_reasons_truncated` says when the tail was dropped, and a narrower window or model filter recovers it.

An orchestrator reading a high                    occupancy with a matching awaiting count is looking at a cluster that                    cannot place pods, not at a busy installation: those slots free when                    capacity appears, not when a task finishes.

         * Take one team out of a shared app's audience
         * @description Revoking is an **audience edit**, not a stop. The named team loses reachability; the app keeps running for every other team it was published to, and for its author. `disableSharedApp` is the safety stop, and it is the one to reach for when an app should not be running at all.
         *
         *     Two authorities can call it, and they are deliberately different sizes. The **author** may revoke any grant on their own app — it is their artifact and its audience is theirs to edit. A **manager** may revoke exactly their own team's grant: a stated "not for my team", which is the authority ADR 0036 gives team managers over what reaches their people, and it requires the team to be enabled and to actually hold the grant. A manager of a disabled team cannot withdraw it — the same predicate `disableSharedApp` uses, and for the same reason: a team that confers nothing is not currently governing anything. There is no administrator arm. An administrator's concern is the artifact, and `disableSharedApp` is where they act on it — so although the widened administrator read now shows them every published or stopped app, calling this on one they neither authored nor manage a granted team of is `404`, the same answer any other outsider gets. Being able to read an app is not being able to edit whose it is.
         *
         *     Anyone else who can read the app is `shared_app_authority_required`, and a caller who cannot reach the app at all is `404`.
         *
         *     Revoking the last grant leaves the app `published` with an empty audience — reachable by its author alone. The status does not snap back to `draft`: `published` records that the author completed the publish ritual, including its authored-content acknowledgment, and grants alone carry the audience. Re-granting the team is `publishSharedApp`, and it is allowed after a manager's revoke — the `shared_apps.grant_updated` trail names both actors, so a standing disagreement inside a team is visible rather than silently arbitrated here.
         *
         *     Viewers' consent rows survive. Consent records what somebody accepted this app may call as them; a grant records who can reach it. Deleting the record of a decision that was really made would be a different thing than withdrawing access.
         *
         *     Idempotent for the **author** only: a team of theirs that held no grant is `204` and writes nothing, because the audit event records an audience changing rather than a request arriving. A manager repeating the call is refused instead, and that is the authority rule rather than an inconsistency — their authority *is* the live grant, so once it is gone there is nothing left for them to be a manager of. Both answers say the grant is not there.

         *
         *     An administrator reads the installation; every other caller reads only their own traffic. The `scope` field says which, because the two responses are otherwise indistinguishable.
         *
         *     Costs are integer micro-US-dollars — 1 000 000 to the dollar — and stay partitioned by payer. `estimated_cost_microusd` is metered spend, `subscription_cost_microusd` is usage a user's subscription absorbed, `provisioned_cost_microusd` is usage provider-provisioned capacity absorbed, and `credits_cost_microusd` is prepaid-credit draw-down. Where `priced_requests` is below `inference_requests` some request had no rate to price it, and the cost is a floor rather than a total; `getCostStateSummary` reports why. Never sum the four cost fields without preserving their different payers.
         *
         *     Every inference rollup also reports prompt-cache visibility: `cached_input_tokens` (input served from a provider cache), `cache_write_input_tokens` (input written to one), and `cache_savings_microusd` — the estimated metered spend caching avoided versus billing every input token at each event's snapshotted base input rate, i.e. the cache-read discount minus the cache-write premium. Savings counts billed rows only, so it pairs with `estimated_cost_microusd`; it is floored so a saving is never overstated, and it is negative when write premiums exceeded read savings.
         *
         *     Filter inference traffic with `user_id`, `team_id`, `model_id`, `client_name`, `sandbox_id`, `repo_slug`, and an inclusive `since` / exclusive `until` window. Add `group_by` with one to three dimensions (`user`, `team`, `model`, `client`, `day`, `sandbox`, `repo`, `execution_kind`) for cross-tabulation. Filter names (`user_id`, `team_id`, `model_id`, `client_name`, `sandbox_id`, `repo_slug`) are accepted as `group_by` aliases. Filtered requests return up to 1,000 matching inference aggregates in `grouped`; `grouped_truncated` says whether more matched.
         *
         *     Unfiltered and window-only reads also include `summary`: the authoritative inference, tool, and app totals for that scope and window. A dimension filter or `group_by` omits it, because those summaries cannot apply those cuts; use `grouped` instead.
         *
         *     Any filter or grouping answers in `grouped` rather than in the rollup arrays, which are then empty — the two are alternatives, not a merged view. `grouped` carries the same committed-attempt efficiency statistics the by-model and by-client rollups report (`committed_requests`, `abandoned_requests`, average / median / 95th-percentile duration and time-to-first-byte, peak context utilization, and mean message and tool-definition counts), so narrowing a question to a window, a client, or a repository does not cost the answer: p95 first-byte for one client over the last seven days is `group_by=client` with `since`. Those statistics exclude abandoned failover attempts — a retried attempt's duration is nobody's wait — while token and cost sums in `grouped` count every attempt; `committed_requests` is the visible denominator.
         *
         *     `repo` groups by the slug recorded on each event, which is what spend was incurred under, not the project a conversation was last resumed in. Events with no slug group as one null-keyed Unlabeled row; `repo_slug` filters for one exact slug and cannot select that remainder. The unfiltered compatibility view includes `by_sandbox` and `by_execution_kind` so agent spend is never blended into a workstation client bucket. Unknown parameters are refused rather than silently ignored.
