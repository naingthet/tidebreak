# 95. Computer use for coding harnesses

- Status: Accepted (the blocklist's app family amended by
  [decision 103](0103-tidebreak-runs-under-its-own-app-identity.md): it
  reserves `io.github.naingthet.tidebreak` and keeps `io.brightwave.tidebreak`)
- Date: 2026-09-08
- Delivery: #3245
- Supersedes the foreground-only, development-app blocklist, and screenshot-redaction limits in decisions 13 and 54.

## Decision

Code sessions receive computer use through a host-owned service. External harnesses use the bundled MCP bridge, with a CLI image-file fallback where necessary. The internal engine calls the same runtime. The existing browser channel remains compatible. Browser and native operations keep distinct schemas and permission scopes.

Screenshot access is part of an explicitly approved app or browser scope. Consent says that visible content reaches the selected model and provider. Automatic redaction is not a guarantee or a prerequisite for capture. Whole-display capture requires its own grant. Existing browser sharing must receive the disclosure before gaining screenshot access.

Native app access does not silently replace denied browser access. Native control of browser windows requires a broader app grant that explains its scope. System authentication and approval interfaces remain under human control. Testing Tidebreak itself must use an isolated development target without access to the controlling instance's approval interface.

Terminals, editors, IDEs, and command launchers use the same explicit app grants as other apps. Control consent for these apps states that the agent can run commands with the user's local account permissions, including outside a coding sandbox. Read and screenshot grants do not authorize control. A list of executable apps cannot enforce a sandbox boundary, so the known development-app list only selects the stronger disclosure.

The hard blocklist retains the `io.brightwave.tidebreak` app family and OS authentication, keychain, and settings surfaces. It does not block other products under the same vendor prefix. To test Tidebreak, build a separate target with a bundle id under `dev.tidebreak.*` and an isolated profile without access to the controlling instance's approval interface. A renamed bundle alone does not establish that isolation. Reserved Tidebreak app ids remain blocked even when a grant exists.

The host derives owner, workspace, and session identity. Each operation carries a request id. Completed results may be recovered; unknown outcomes require inspection before another action. An interrupt cancels pending input and releases ownership. Session termination revokes access. Restart invalidates transient targets and controllers.

Independent tabs may operate concurrently when their adapters isolate input. Native actions retain host input ownership to serialize app-local event sequences and recovery. Human takeover ends that ownership before another queued action can begin. The agent never posts input to the global desktop or changes the hardware pointer.

The three adapters cover Tidebreak's in-app browser, native macOS apps, and Chrome. Chrome uses an approved local debugging connection. Managed Chrome starts with a separate temporary profile. Existing Chrome access has a separate disclosure covering all web tabs exposed by that instance, including signed-in pages. The model cannot supply debugger endpoints. Developer diagnostics require explicit authority.

All agent actions use independent input. Legacy requests for foreground control fail before input or consent. Focus and return-control tools are not advertised. An unsupported independent action must explain its limitation; it must never fall back to desktop takeover.

Chrome uses CDP input without activating a tab or bringing its window forward. The in-app browser uses DOM actions where those actions have the required behavior. Trusted embedded-browser input requires a separate agent-owned window that cannot become the key or main window. Page focus must stay within that window. A human explicitly takes ownership before the tab rejoins the main window.

Native apps use accessibility operations or events bound to the approved process and window. The host checks the process launch identity, window identity, and geometry before dispatch. Input cancellation releases held buttons and keys only to that same process. Unrelated pointer movement or switching between other apps must not interrupt independent work. If the person starts using the target app, the agent stops sending new input.

A teal ghost cursor marks the agent's action position without receiving input. The overlay cannot become key, take focus, or intercept clicks. Stop clears it and prevents queued actions until explicit Resume. An older Resume approval cannot clear a newer Stop.

Independent input does not imply that every app handles every event. Native tracking areas may ignore injected movement, and embedded WebKit key handling can request changes to system cursor visibility. Qualification must check the target's visible effect and the person's pointer, foreground app, and editor focus. Synthetic DOM events must not claim trusted input, CSS hover, or native drag-and-drop behavior that they do not produce.

## Implementation contract

`computer_session::ComputerUseCall` and `ComputerUseResult` separate request identity, outcome, text, structured data, and image bytes. Native tool schemas and validation come from `computer_use_tool_specs` and `validate_computer_use_arguments`. Transport code does not duplicate tool schemas or implement grants.

The native runtime must reuse the host broker and native consent path. Browser work retains its existing origin, visibility, controller, and stale-target checks. Image adapters fit results within the supported transport budget without dumping base64 into model text.

## Qualification

- Every supported harness receives the intended tool set and actual image content.
- In-app browser, Chrome, and native app workflows cover launch, observation, click, type, hover, drag, scroll, waits, screenshots, and verification.
- Real coding tasks reproduce a problem, edit code, rebuild, and repeat the UI flow.
- Tests cover wrong-session calls, changed targets, Stop, takeover, reconnect, uncertain outcomes, and concurrent input.
- macOS native and packaged evidence is recorded separately from Linux or simulated tests.

Before merge, the integration PR must have no unresolved P1 or P2 findings. Reviewers may report no findings. Formatting, focused behavior tests, build checks, and real native acceptance determine completion.
