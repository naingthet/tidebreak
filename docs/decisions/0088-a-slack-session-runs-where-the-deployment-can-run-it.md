- Supersedes: the "do not ship Slack on the machine engine" paragraph of `docs/slack-sessions.md`

## Context

`docs/slack-sessions.md` said a Slack session runs in a gateway sandbox and
nowhere else, and `CodeRuntime::external_get_or_create` enforced it: a
machine with no sandbox runtime endpoint refused every external session
with `remote_disabled`. The reasoning was sound for the posture it named. A
Slack session was unattended `Allow` with a forge token, and the sandbox
was the defense in depth for exactly that.

Two things changed. First, the machine engine is what every other client
already uses: the desktop, the mobile app, and `agent-mcp` all drive
harness children on the machine, parked when idle (decision 64), with
inference through the relay (decision 71). Second, the rule left whole
deployments without a single Slack session: every standalone machine, and
every gateway deployment until an operator configures a runtime. The
adapter's end-to-end lane found this
on its first run, and the reference deployment found the sandbox path
itself unfinished (#3216).

## Decision

**Execution location is chosen per session from what the deployment has.**
At external get-or-create the machine picks a gateway sandbox when a
sandbox runtime is configured, else its own engine. The choice is stored
on the session as `execution_location` (`sandbox` or `machine`, an appended
migration that backfills existing rows from their workspaces), reported on
the snapshot and the external event stream, and never changes for the
session's life.

**The machine engine is the floor, not an interim path.** A machine
session is an ordinary session: a worktree under the owner's worktree
root, the same worker, the same lazy spawn and park, the same checkpoints
and delivery. The external routes that took a sandbox for granted now
dispatch by location: a message on a machine session lands in the same
durable queue, wakes the worker, and answers `new_turn` when the head is
promoted; interrupt, reap, and the event stream already branch on the
workspace and keep doing so.

**Permission mode follows the location.** A sandbox session keeps `Allow`
because confinement is its boundary (decision 39). A machine session takes
the deployment's default mode; the owner answers approvals from the
desktop or the web, where the session is visible like any other, until
the channel can carry them. `Allow` on the machine is an operator's
setting per deployment, off by default, and a later slice adds it
together with the per-session override the adapter exposes.

## Consequences

- Every deployment can run a Slack session. The reference deployment moves
  its Slack sessions onto the machine engine until the sandbox path is
  finished (#3216); a configured runtime stays the way to choose the
  sandbox.
- The adapter renders which location a session runs on from the snapshot,
  so the thread's first status line can say where the work happens.
- A machine session shares the machine's worktree root and providers with
  the owner's other sessions. The owner-text-only rule and the session
  access rows (decision 86) are the controls; nothing else changes.
- What this does not decide: the operator's `Allow` setting, the
  per-session mode override on the external routes, spend accounting per
  location, and the sandbox path's own defects. Each is its own slice.

## Amendment 2026-09-07: the operator's mode and the channel's request

The "later slice" above landed as two deployment settings and one request
field. `TIDEBREAK_EXTERNAL_PERMISSION_MODE` is the mode a machine session
takes when the channel names none, `ask` by default;
`TIDEBREAK_EXTERNAL_PERMISSION_CEILING` is the most permissive mode a
channel may name, defaulting to the mode so a raised default never admits
more than itself. The external get-or-create request carries an optional
`permission_mode`; on the machine it is honored up to the ceiling and
refused by name above it (`permission_mode_above_ceiling`), and on a
sandbox deployment anything but `allow` is refused
(`permission_mode_unsupported`) because confinement, not consent, is that
placement's boundary. `Allow` on the machine therefore stays an
operator's decision per deployment, taken once at boot, and a channel can
only ask within it.

## Amendment 2026-09-08: placement defaults for external sessions only

The deployment default (sandbox when a runtime is configured, else
machine) applies at external get-or-create only. Desktop, mobile, and
`agent-mcp` sessions on the same machine keep machine execution and the
utilities that go with it: terminal, diffs, scripts, previews. A
configured runtime is not a server-wide sandbox-only switch.

`execution_location` on the session is the only dispatch rule after
create. Turns, queue drain, worker attach, and recovery read that
column. They do not re-derive placement from the workspace or from a
process-wide flag. A message typed on the web into a sandbox session
reaches the sandbox lease (or a typed conflict if the lease is gone),
never a local engine spawn.
