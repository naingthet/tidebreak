# Releases and versioning

Tidebreak uses one Semantic Version for the desktop product. A published native
GitHub Release and its `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag are the source of truth. There is
no release branch, release pull request, or committed version-bump commit.

The `0.0.0` values in Cargo, Tauri, and the private UI package are development
metadata. On a release build, the workflow validates the tag, passes its version
to Tauri through a configuration overlay, and exports `TIDEBREAK_VERSION` so Rust
code reports and gates on the same product version.

## Classify every pull request

Pull request titles use a Conventional Commits header:

```text
type(optional-scope)[!]: description
```

CI validates the title, and squash merge makes it the commit title on `main`.
Scopes are optional and descriptive; common examples are `core`, `server`,
`desktop`, `mcp`, `cli`, `deps`, and `release`.

| Title type                                          | Use for                                              | Release effect |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `feat`                                              | New user-visible capability                          | Minor          |
| `improve`                                           | User-visible polish or behavior improvement          | Patch          |
| `fix`                                               | User-visible defect correction                       | Patch          |
| `perf`                                              | User-visible performance improvement                 | Patch          |
| `deps`                                              | Shipped runtime dependency update                    | Patch          |
| `revert`                                            | Reversal of a previously shipped change              | Patch          |
| `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`  | Non-user-facing maintenance                          | None           |
| `feat`, `improve`, `fix`, `perf`, `deps`, or `revert` with `!` | Breaking product, API, data, or configuration change | Breaking       |

Examples:

```text
feat(desktop): add document search
improve(desktop): simplify settings navigation
fix(core): prevent duplicate turn completion
deps(cargo): update the database stack
revert: restore the previous storage behavior
feat(core)!: replace the persisted conversation format
docs: explain local model configuration
```

Choose the type based on user impact, not the files changed. Use `improve` when
the product works but the change makes an existing experience better. A
refactor that fixes observable behavior is `fix`; a build change that adds a
shipped capability is `feat`. Classify a breaking refactor as `feat!`,
`improve!`, or `fix!` based on its user impact. CI rejects `!` on
maintenance-only types. If the PR body has a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, its
title must also carry `!` so the impact is visible during review.

GitHub Actions dependency updates remain `ci(deps)` and do not release the
product. Cargo Dependabot updates use `deps` because those dependencies ship in
the desktop app.

User-facing PRs also receive a managed release-note label derived from the same
validated title. These labels make the native release notes easier to scan
without asking authors to classify a PR twice:

| Title type | Release-notes section          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | ✨ New Features                |
| `improve`  | 🌟 Improvements                |
| `fix`      | 🐛 Bug Fixes                   |
| `perf`     | ⚡ Performance Improvements    |
| `deps`     | 📦 Dependency Updates          |
| `revert`   | ⏪ Reverted Changes            |
| Any `!`    | 💥 Breaking Changes            |

Documentation and other maintenance-only types carry no `release-note:*` label
and appear in a trailing **🧰 Maintenance** section instead — listed, not dropped,
because a maintenance change can still matter to someone updating (a schema
baseline rebuild, a toolchain requirement). Every merged PR is accounted for in
the notes. The rendered notes open with a thank-you. Category headings carry a
leading emoji so the sections scan quickly, and the draft does not wrap them in
a page-level heading; the release title is the tag. First-time contributors get
their own section, and the notes end with a compare link to the previous tag.
The section heading supplies the type, so the draft formatter removes the
redundant Conventional Commit prefix from each PR title. Maintenance entries
keep their full prefixes: that section mixes types, so the prefix is the
information. When a category has
multiple user-facing changes with the same scope, the formatter groups them
under a third-level heading: for example, multiple `feat(desktop)` changes are
rendered under **✨ New Features**, then **Desktop**. A singleton scope is kept
compact as an inline prefix, and unscoped changes appear in the flat tail of the
section.

For historical or imported pull requests, the **Release draft** workflow has a
manual `workflow_dispatch` backfill. Its default dry run reports the exact
changes; rerun it with `apply` enabled to synchronize only the managed
`semver:*` and `release-note:*` labels from titles that pass the current policy.
It deliberately leaves free-form historical titles in **Other Changes** rather
than guessing their impact. The job uses the repository `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so its
label writes do not fan out into hundreds of labeled-event workflow runs.

## How the native release draft works

The release-draft workflow keeps exactly one draft GitHub Release up to date:

1. A trusted workflow maps the validated PR title to exactly one managed
   `semver:*` label and, for a non-breaking user-facing change, one managed
   `release-note:*` category label. Required CI verifies that exact label set
   before merge.
2. After the PR is squash-merged to `main`, Release Drafter adds it to the
   native draft, groups the release notes into the sections above, and suggests
   the next tag. The draft formatter then groups repeated scoped Conventional
   Commit titles beneath scope subheadings and keeps other entries compact at
   the end of their section. Breaking changes are always shown first.
3. Maintenance-only PRs land in the trailing **Maintenance** section, so every
   merged PR is accounted for in the notes. The largest release effect among
   all PRs chooses the proposed version; the category labels do not
   independently change the version, and a maintenance-only release proposes a
   patch bump.
4. Before Release Drafter runs, the job lists GitHub Releases and `v*` tags
   (retrying a few times) and refuses to invoke it when version tags exist
   but no published release is visible. That is the outage that would
   otherwise mint a `v0.0.1` draft. If Release Drafter still loses the
   baseline after that check, the job deletes the fallback and fails so a
   later merge or a manual **Release draft** dispatch with **update-draft**
   can try again. Extra drafts are collapsed so publish still sees exactly
   one.

The first release has no previous published release to use as a comparison
baseline, so Release Drafter intentionally leaves that draft as a manual
starting point. For `v0.1.0`, set the tag deliberately and click **Generate
release notes** in GitHub; `.github/release.yml` applies the same sections to
GitHub's native output. GitHub's native generator cannot create dynamic scope
subheadings, so add those manually if desired for that one-time full-history
release. Curate that result before publishing. From then on, the last published
tag and the managed PR labels make the maintained draft and its proposed version
automatic.

## Publishing a release

1. Open **Releases** in GitHub and select the existing draft.
2. Confirm the target is the intended commit on `main`, the proposed
   `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag is correct, the release is not marked as a
   prerelease, and the notes contain the intended PRs.
   For the first release only, set `v0.1.0`, click **Generate release notes**,
   and curate the full-history result as described above.
3. Complete the release-readiness review, but do **not** publish the draft in
   GitHub. Immutable releases cannot accept assets after publication.
4. Open **Actions → Publish desktop release → Run workflow** and select
   `main`. Leave the tag blank to publish the current draft. Enter a tag only
   to retry that draft, an in-flight prerelease, or an already-published release.
   The workflow resolves a blank tag to the single non-prerelease draft, rejects
   a missing or ambiguous draft and malformed tags, creates the tag at the
   current `main` commit when it does not already exist, and retains the same
   tag on a retry. It snapshots the draft metadata so a later merge cannot
   change the notes or proposed version while the build is running, and pins
   every later job to the frozen commit SHA. Immediately after the snapshot, the
   draft is marked as a prerelease but stays a draft so assets can still be
   attached. Release Drafter only updates non-prerelease drafts, so later
   merges start a new notes draft instead of appending to the in-flight
   release. The GitHub Release is published only after those assets are
   attached.
5. The workflow compiles the tag once in credential-free macOS and Windows
   prerequisite jobs, with its product version. Each prerequisite uploads the
   final desktop binary, sidecars, and Tauri configuration in a run-scoped
   archive with SHA-256 manifests.
6. The macOS and Windows production jobs verify those archives before loading
   signing material, then run `tauri bundle` against the prepared binaries.
   They do not compile Rust or rebuild the frontend. With Apple signing
   configured, the macOS job signs the app with the Developer ID identity,
   submits the DMG to Apple's notary service once, staples the resulting
   ticket to both the DMG and the app, and verifies them with Apple tooling.
   Without it, the job signs the app ad-hoc and skips notarization, and the
   published release notes explain how to open the app; see
   [Production signing configuration](#production-signing-configuration).
   Either way the job creates a Tauri updater archive signed with the updater
   key. Parallel Windows and Linux jobs produce x86_64 and ARM64 NSIS,
   AppImage, and Debian packages; every package is signed with the Tauri
   updater key after packaging. A release cannot continue unless every
   operating-system and architecture build the dispatch selected succeeds.
   Windows and Linux are paused by default; see
   [Paused platforms](#paused-platforms).
7. A separate least-privilege job generates an SPDX JSON SBOM from the exact
   released source and checksums it independently of the package builds. That
   job has no production environment, deployment variables, or OIDC
   permission; it transfers the two files through a pinned GitHub artifact
   action. The source-tree SBOM is deliberately published as source-scoped
   metadata, not attested as a description of the packaged installers.
8. A credential-free job gathers the verified build outputs, refuses to
   publish a version older than the latest published release, and generates
   `manifest.json` and the updater feed `latest.json` with
   `scripts/create-release-manifests.mjs`. Every URL in them points at the
   tag's own release downloads,
   `https://github.com/naingthet/tidebreak/releases/download/<tag>/<asset>`.
   The job attaches every versioned package, updater signature, checksum
   sidecar, the source SBOM, and both manifests to the draft, plus stable
   download names: the disk image as `Tidebreak-macos-universal.dmg` with a
   byte-identical `Tidebreak-macos-apple-silicon.dmg` alias, and the
   architecture-specific Windows installers, Linux AppImages, and Linux Debian
   packages. The stable names omit the version so that
   `https://github.com/naingthet/tidebreak/releases/latest/download/<name>`
   stays a permanent download link for the README. On a public repository the
   job first records a provenance attestation for every file the run built.
   It holds no signing credentials.
9. Only after every asset is present does the workflow restore the frozen
   title and notes and publish the draft. GitHub then locks the release tag
   and assets, and
   `https://github.com/naingthet/tidebreak/releases/latest/download/latest.json`
   starts serving the new feed to installed apps. The workflow then dispatches
   the server image build and refreshes the next release draft, so
   **Publish server image** and **Release draft** must stay enabled.
10. Dispatching the workflow again for a release that is already published
    rebuilds and uploads nothing. It downloads the published assets, checks
    every checksum, regenerates `latest.json` from `manifest.json`, and
    compares the result with the published feed.

Running **Publish desktop release** is the only release operation. Merging
ordinary PRs updates the draft but never builds or ships a desktop version, and
manually clicking GitHub's **Publish release** button is not part of the
procedure. The GitHub Release becomes public only after its verified assets are
attached, and publishing it is what ships: the updater feed and the README's
download links follow the latest published release.

The documentation site deploys separately. The **Publish documentation**
workflow builds `docs-site/` and deploys it to GitHub Pages at
`https://naingthet.github.io/tidebreak/docs/` on every push to `main` that
changes it.

## Public desktop delivery

### One universal macOS application

A release ships one universal app, DMG, zip, and signed updater archive. Tauri
builds the desktop for both `aarch64-apple-darwin` and
`x86_64-apple-darwin` and combines the app executable. The before-build hook
builds the host broker for both targets and combines those slices with `lipo`
before bundling. Release verification rejects the bundle unless both the main
executable and the host broker contain both slices.

`RELEASE_PLATFORMS` in `scripts/create-release-manifests.mjs` is the single
source of truth for what a release contains: it drives the manifest, the
`latest.json` platform keys, and the release asset names. The manifest
contains one universal macOS artifact set; `latest.json` advertises
that same signed updater archive under both `darwin-aarch64` and
`darwin-x86_64`, so either native updater downloads identical universal bytes.

Re-dispatching the workflow for a published release checks its manifest
against the current platform set. A release published before a platform change
fails that check on its artifact names and updater keys instead of passing
with a different release shape.

### The release that changes the app identity

The desktop runs as `io.github.naingthet.tidebreak`. Releases before it ran as
`io.brightwave.tidebreak`, and the identifier names the data folder, the
webview's storage, the keychain entry, and the macOS permissions
([decision 103](decisions/0103-tidebreak-runs-under-its-own-app-identity.md)).
The updater still replaces the installed app in place. On its first launch the
new build moves the previous identity's data folder, webview storage, and
keychain item to its own before it opens anything, and says so once.

What a person sees on macOS after that update: the app asks again for
Accessibility and Screen Recording, because macOS grants them to an identity,
and macOS may ask whether Tidebreak can use the keychain item the earlier
build created. Before you publish the first release under the new identity,
update a test machine from the last earlier release and check that its
conversations, settings, window storage, and keys arrived.

### Paused platforms

Windows and Linux packaging is paused. Nobody is asking for newer builds, and
the macOS lane already gates every release, so building three platforms only
costs runner time and adds failure surface. The `platforms` input on the
release workflow records the choice. The Windows and Linux jobs, artifact
downloads, and manifest entries all key off it: `all` builds every platform
and `macos` skips the Windows and Linux jobs. The input's default is what a
draft publishes with; change it to resume those platforms for every release,
or dispatch the workflow with `all` for one release. A retry of an existing
release must repeat the selection its original run used, because the attached
manifest is checked against that platform set.

The default is `macos`. It flipped after v0.109.0, the release that shipped
the desktop updater's missing-platform handling (`TargetNotFound` reads as
"no update", added in #3462) to Windows and Linux; an older client would
otherwise report a failed update check on startup once `latest.json` dropped
its platform. Keeping the old entries in the feed was not an alternative: the
feed carries one version, so a client would install the same old package on
every check. Retry a release at or before v0.109.0 with `all`.

While paused, a release still keeps the README's permanent download links
working: the `attach_downloads` job copies the stable-name Windows and Linux
installers and their `.sha256` sidecars from the previous published GitHub
release into the new one. Versioned packages and updater signatures are not
carried, so `latest.json` lists only macOS and an installed Windows or Linux
app reports no update rather than a build that does not exist. The last
release that built every platform is the one those carried downloads come
from; find it by following the chain of release pages back to one with
versioned `Tidebreak_<version>_<arch>` Windows and Linux assets. A repository
with no earlier release, or whose latest release carries no Windows or Linux
downloads, has nothing to carry: that release ships macOS downloads only, and
the Windows and Linux links work once a release includes those platforms.

### Windows: unsigned x86_64 and ARM64 NSIS

A release ships one Windows NSIS `-setup.exe` installer for each of `x86_64`
and `aarch64`. NSIS is the one installer format for v1 because Tauri bundles it
with no additional configuration and it installs per-user without elevation.
The installer is deliberately **not** Authenticode-signed yet, so Windows
SmartScreen will warn on first run; code signing is tracked separately and
must not be confused with the Tauri updater signature the release does carry.
Each updater signature covers the exact installer bytes and feeds the matching
`windows-x86_64` or `windows-aarch64` entry. Tauri v2 installs updates from the
installer itself, so no separate updater archive exists on Windows. Release
builds check that authenticated feed and ask before restarting into the new
installer.

The credential-free `prepare_windows` and `prepare_windows_desktop` jobs reuse
compiler outputs from sccache's GitHub Actions cache backend. They compile
the sidecars and desktop in parallel for the
exact release tag and product version, then save separate prepared archives for
the credentialed packaging job. The Windows ARM jobs keep the
`aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` Rust target and compile whisper.cpp with Ninja plus
`clang-cl`, because ggml refuses MSVC on ARM. After the compile, each job
transfers only its final binaries and Tauri configuration to the production
job. The production job verifies and bundles those files without installing a
compiler or rebuilding the frontend.

Windows code mode uses the desktop's digest-verified managed Node ZIP and
pinned harness packages. Setup, archive, and quick-action commands run through
Windows PowerShell, while harness and command descendants are owned as one
process tree for interruption and timeout. Native local execution, managed
LibreOffice installation, and computer use remain separate platform
capabilities and are not implied by code-mode support.

### Linux: x86_64 and ARM64 AppImage and Debian packages

A release ships one portable AppImage and one `.deb` for each of `x86_64` and
`aarch64` Linux. Every package carries a Tauri updater signature over its exact
bytes, and `latest.json` publishes architecture- and format-specific entries so
an installed package can only select its own architecture and format. None of
the packages is distribution-signed in this shipping slice.

Release builds check the authenticated feed and ask before restarting. Tauri's
installed-bundle detection selects AppImage or Debian metadata before download.
Linux code mode uses the desktop's digest-verified managed Node runtime and
pinned harness packages. Native local execution, managed LibreOffice
installation, and computer use remain governed by their existing platform
capability checks; packaging the desktop does not claim those features on
Linux.

The Linux packaging job reads and writes compiler outputs through sccache's
GitHub Actions cache backend. It uses the Cargo download cache without storing target
outputs and does not enable pnpm caching. It builds both formats from the
validated release tag before the updater private key enters the step
environment, then signs and collects only the completed package bytes. The
compile step can write cache entries without receiving the updater key.

The Linux packaging step extracts its dependency installer from the dispatching
workflow SHA while keeping application HEAD at the validated release SHA. Default
amd64 downloads use HTTPS Ubuntu endpoints, then kernel.org if needed. Each
mirror gets 60 seconds for indexes and 100 seconds for downloads, with a
five-second termination grace per phase. The 340-second download bound leaves
time for the final `--no-download` install within the eight-minute step. ARM and
explicit endpoint overrides keep their existing installation path. APT signature
checks stay enabled.

The public download contract is this repository's GitHub Releases. Every
release carries flat assets under its tag's download path,
`https://github.com/naingthet/tidebreak/releases/download/vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH/`:

```text
manifest.json and latest.json
Tidebreak_VERSION_universal.dmg, .app.zip, .app.tar.gz, and .app.tar.gz.sig
Tidebreak_VERSION_ARCH-setup.exe and its .sig             (when Windows is built)
Tidebreak_VERSION_ARCH.AppImage, .deb, and their .sig     (when Linux is built)
Tidebreak_VERSION_source.spdx.json
Tidebreak-macos-universal.dmg and the other version-free download names
```

Every file has a `.sha256` sidecar. The updater feed is the newest published
release's `latest.json`, which GitHub serves at
`https://github.com/naingthet/tidebreak/releases/latest/download/latest.json`.
The workflow refuses to publish a version older than the latest published
release, and GitHub's immutable releases keep a published release's assets
from changing.

Verify the independently signed provenance for any downloaded artifact with
GitHub CLI:

```sh
gh attestation verify Tidebreak-macos-universal.dmg \
  --repo naingthet/tidebreak
```

GitHub artifact attestations are free for public repositories. A private copy
of this repository on a plan without them skips the attestation step and still
publishes the checksummed, source-scoped SBOM. The SBOM inventories the
released source checkout; it must not be interpreted as an inventory of files
or dependencies embedded in the DMG, app bundle, or updater archive.

Packaged macOS apps check `latest.json` 15 seconds after launch and every
hour. When a newer signed version is available, the Tauri updater downloads
it in the background, verifies its signature, and stages the archive in an
`updates` folder under the app's cache directory. The app then emits a ready
state to the UI. The user must choose **Restart to update** before Tidebreak
reads the staged archive back, checks that it still matches what was
verified, installs it, and relaunches; the app never interrupts active work
automatically. A staged archive that a newer release supersedes, that the
feed withdraws, or that fails to install is deleted, and each launch deletes
archives that earlier runs left behind. The app checks that the `updates`
folder takes a file before it downloads. If saving a downloaded archive
fails, for example on a full disk, automatic downloads stop until the next
launch or until the user chooses **Download update**, and the Updates panel
says why. With **Download updates
automatically** turned off in **Settings → Updates**, or by the
`DownloadUpdatesAutomatically` [managed policy](managed-policy.md), the app
still checks and reports the update as available, and downloads it only when
the user chooses **Download update**. Development builds do not contact an update feed.

The first release containing this client integration is a bootstrap release:
older installed binaries have no updater and therefore cannot discover it.
Users must install that first updater-enabled release manually; subsequent
releases can advance automatically.

Continuous integration and release jobs reuse Rust compiler outputs through
sccache's GitHub Actions cache backend. Pull requests read the cache and never
write it; pushes to `main`, scheduled and manual runs, and releases write it.
GitHub scopes each cache entry to the ref that wrote it, so a pull request
cannot change what `main` reads.
The credential-free release jobs compile the exact tag and product version, so
version-sensitive product crates may miss while shared dependencies still hit.
The separate Cargo download caches retain `cache-targets: false` and do not
store compiler outputs.

Each release architecture saves a run-scoped archive containing the unsigned
products produced by `--no-bundle`: the desktop executable, host broker, and
desktop libraries. The archive transfers verified inputs to the credentialed
packaging job; it does not populate the shared compiler cache. On macOS, one
`macos-latest` runner compiles each real architecture. A third credential-free
job verifies both prepared slices, combines the desktop binary and both
sidecars with `lipo`, and uploads the universal inputs and Tauri configuration
in a one-day artifact. The `desktop-production` job verifies that artifact
before it loads signing material, then packages those exact binaries without
compiling again. If the cache has no matching entry, the release job compiles
it and writes it for a later build.

The signing and notarization job stays on its own standard runner because it
receives the prepared universal inputs and does not compile the application.

### Production signing configuration

The release jobs that sign run in a GitHub environment named
`desktop-production`, which GitHub creates the first time a release runs.
Store the secrets below as repository secrets or as that environment's
secrets. Two are required:

| Secret                               | Value                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`          | Private key that signs Tauri updater archives and the voice helper    |
| `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` | Password for that key                                                 |

Retain the Tauri updater keypair. Its public key is committed in
`crates/tidebreak-desktop/tauri.conf.json` so packaged apps can verify update
signatures, and `crates/tidebreak-desktop/src/whisper_install.rs` pins the
same key for the voice helper. Only the private key and its password belong in
GitHub secrets.

Apple signing is optional. Configure all six values below to sign the macOS
app with a Developer ID certificate and notarize it. Configure none of them to
ship an ad-hoc signed build; its release notes then tell people how to open
it. A partial set fails the release rather than quietly falling back.

| Name                         | Kind     | Value                                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`          | secret   | Base64-encoded Developer ID Application `.p12` |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | secret   | Password used when exporting that `.p12`       |
| `APPLE_API_PRIVATE_KEY`      | secret   | Complete App Store Connect `.p8` private key   |
| `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`     | variable | Developer ID Application signing identity      |
| `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`           | variable | App Store Connect API key ID                   |
| `APPLE_API_ISSUER`           | variable | App Store Connect API issuer UUID              |

An ad-hoc signed app is not notarized, so macOS blocks it the first time it
opens. macOS also ties Accessibility and Screen Recording grants and keychain
access to the exact ad-hoc build, so people may need to grant them again after
each update.

The workflow references Apple secrets only in the macOS job. Windows and Linux
receive only the Tauri updater key in their artifact verification steps, and
publication uses the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Before the first release,
consider required reviewers on `desktop-production`.

### Release CI and cache security

The release workflow runs in public:

- Release actions are pinned to immutable commit SHAs. Dependabot is responsible
  for proposing reviewed action updates.
- An explicit manual dispatch on the protected `main` workflow freezes the
  native draft's tag before any production build. The build accepts only a
  non-prerelease release whose resolved commit is on `main`, and it publishes
  the GitHub Release only after attaching verified assets. It never runs with
  production secrets for a pull request or a manually selected feature branch.
- The jobs that build and sign check out that immutable commit SHA. The job
  that generates the manifests and attaches assets deliberately checks out the
  dispatching `main` commit instead, so it runs the release automation as it
  exists on `main` rather than as it existed at the tag. The consequence to
  keep in mind: manifests are produced by main-tip `scripts/`, so a change to
  `scripts/create-release-manifests.mjs` alters what a *rerun* of an older
  draft would generate. A rerun of a published release only verifies it, so it
  cannot overwrite what shipped.
- Apple and Tauri credentials stay in GitHub secrets. The Tauri private key
  reaches the configuration-validation precheck that runs before the build, and
  the post-notarization updater-signing and artifact-verification steps. It is
  not passed to the Tauri build action itself. No other credential exists:
  publication uses the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
- The Developer ID certificate is imported into an ephemeral runner keychain
  before Tauri invokes the release-only resource-signing hook. The workflow
  verifies the configured identity is available, then deletes the keychain and
  decoded certificate even when the build fails.
- The credential-free release builds read and write sccache's GitHub Actions
  cache. They compile the exact tag and version
  with `--no-bundle`, then save release-specific prepared archives before
  reporting a compile failure. They have no production environment or signing
  secrets. The secret-bearing jobs restore and verify those archives before
  loading production secrets. The archives include explicitly named unsigned
  products and the Rust build state required by the release. They never include
  bundle directories, signed apps, DMGs, updater archives, signatures,
  keychains, or temporary Apple key files. The separate Cargo download cache
  retains `cache-targets: false`.
- Production artifacts are collected only after code-signing, notarization,
  stapling, and local verification succeed. The temporary App Store Connect key
  is removed even when the build fails.
- A retry never overwrites a published release. For a published release the
  workflow downloads the attached assets, checks every checksum, and checks
  the published `latest.json` against its `manifest.json`; it uploads nothing.
- With Apple signing configured, notarization happens once per build: Tauri
  signs the app and DMG without
  notary credentials, then the workflow submits the signed DMG to Apple's
  notary service, requires an accepted result, and staples that one ticket to
  both the DMG and the identically signed app bundle before artifact
  verification or upload. The App Store Connect key reaches the job
  environment only after bundling.

Public source does not eliminate the need for operational controls. Restrict
who can publish releases and change Actions configuration, protect `main` with
a ruleset, and consider required reviewers on `desktop-production`. Never add a
pull-request trigger to the production workflow or expose its secrets to code
from forks.

### Third-party notices

Every shipped desktop artifact carries the licenses of the software it
redistributes. `legal/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` is generated from the resolved
Cargo workspace graph and the desktop UI's production npm graph by
`scripts/generate-third-party-notices.mjs`, and is checked in so a reviewer can
see exactly what a change to either lockfile adds to the product's obligations.

- Regenerate it with `node scripts/generate-third-party-notices.mjs` after any
  dependency change. The generator resolves the Cargo graph with every feature
  and installs the UI's production closure for every platform into a scratch
  directory, so the output is the same on any host: a package that ships one
  native build per platform is listed in full rather than as the variant the
  generating machine happens to run. CI's `third-party notices` lane runs the
  same generator with `--check` and fails on drift, and the release build
  repeats that check before signing, so a tag can never ship notices that
  disagree with its lockfiles.
- The generator reads license facts from each package's own vendored files and
  manifest. `cargo metadata` and the scratch `pnpm install` only resolve the
  graphs and put the packages on disk, so neither tool's license classification
  can rewrite the notices. Declared expressions are reproduced verbatim, including compound
  ones; identical license texts are stored once and referenced by a
  content-addressed identifier.
- A package that declares no license is recorded as such rather than guessed
  at. Those entries are the ones to review: the notices are a compliance
  artifact, and an undeclared license in a distributed dependency is a question
  for a human, not something the generator should paper over.
- When that review settles a package's terms, the answer is recorded as a
  curated override in `CURATED_NODE_LICENSES` rather than left implicit. An
  override states the evidence it rests on, and the generator re-checks that
  evidence on every run: the package must still declare no license of its own,
  and its repository must still point where the review looked. Either check
  failing is a hard error, so a package that starts declaring a license, or
  whose repository moves, comes back for review instead of inheriting an old
  answer. Overrides quote license text from `scripts/license-texts/`, never
  from the network, so the output stays reproducible offline.
- Both graphs are host-independent today, so regenerating on macOS and checking
  on Linux agree. `cargo metadata` reports every package the lockfile can ship
  regardless of target, and no production UI dependency is platform-specific. If
  one ever is, pnpm will resolve a different closure per platform and the CI
  lane will disagree with a locally generated file — that disagreement is the
  signal to decide deliberately which platforms the notices must cover, not to
  regenerate until it passes.
- Tauri stages the file, along with `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`, into
  `Contents/Resources/legal/` of the app bundle. The DMG, the `.app.zip`, and
  the updater archive are all derived from that bundle, so the release lane
  verifies the bundled bytes match the checked-in files once, after signing.
  Windows and Linux packages inherit the same resource map; their packaging
  jobs verify the shared release inputs before producing artifacts.

## Before 1.0

While the latest published version is below `1.0.0`, improvements and fixes
increment patch, features increment minor, and breaking changes also increment
minor. The `semver:breaking` version-resolver entry in
`.github/release-drafter.yml` encodes that pre-1.0 behavior.

For example, `0.3.2` becomes `0.3.3` for an improvement or fix and `0.4.0` for
either a feature or a breaking pre-1.0 change.

Desktop upgrades from **v0.61.0** onward keep local data, and every 1.x
release keeps that promise
([decision 100](decisions/0100-the-1-0-compatibility-surface.md)). That
includes the update that changes the app identity: its first launch moves the
data folder instead of starting an empty one
([decision 103](decisions/0103-tidebreak-runs-under-its-own-app-identity.md)). Schema
changes after that pin are appended migrations
([decision 61](decisions/0061-schema-changes-are-migrations.md)). Before an
update applies a migration, the desktop app copies the database to
`backups/pre-migration-<version>-<timestamp>.db` in its data directory and
keeps the two newest copies. A profile from **v0.60.0 or earlier** predates the
recorded baseline, so the first post-pin build moves it into
`backups/unrecognized-<timestamp>/` and starts a fresh one. Nothing deletes it,
but Tidebreak cannot bring back projects that builds before v0.61.0 already
reset. Hosted PostgreSQL never used the epoch; it upgrades in place.

## Preparing and shipping 1.0.0

`1.0.0` is a deliberate compatibility commitment, and
[decision 100](decisions/0100-the-1-0-compatibility-surface.md) records what
it keeps compatible. The desktop schema guard already accepts product majors
`0` and `1` with the same append-only migration chain, so a `v1.0.0` app opens
every profile that v0.61.0 or later wrote. It refuses any later major until
that major defines its own upgrade path.

1. Confirm that decision 100 still matches the product: the local data
   promise, the CLI commands, flags, exit codes, and JSON output, the
   `agent-mcp` tools, the `-p` stdin decision protocol, and the supported
   platforms.
2. Keep the migration chain. Do not squash it into a new baseline, do not move
   `LAST_RESET_EPOCH`, and do not add a path that deletes a profile. A squash
   renames the first migration, so every existing database would record names
   the release does not know, and the release meant to upgrade those profiles
   would refuse them instead. Schema changes stay appended migrations
   ([decision 61](decisions/0061-schema-changes-are-migrations.md)).
   `a_major_one_build_opens_a_0x_profile_and_keeps_its_data` in
   `crates/tidebreak-server/src/desktop_schema.rs` pins that a 1.x build opens
   a 0.x profile with its data.
3. Verify the provisioned release pipeline with clean install and 0.x upgrade
   smoke tests on macOS and both Windows architectures, clean install and
   update checks for both Linux Debian architectures, and AppImage launch and
   update checks on a second distribution.
4. Confirm that `SECURITY.md` still names the supported release line and how
   fixes ship, and that the backup and restore steps in the troubleshooting
   guide and in [self-hosting](self-hosting.md#upgrading) match the release.
5. In the same readiness work, change the `semver:breaking` version resolver's
   `semver-increment` from `minor` to `major`. This activates normal SemVer for
   all releases after 1.0.
6. Finish the last 0.x release if needed, review the accumulated native draft,
   set its tag to exactly `v1.0.0`, and publish it.
7. Verify the tag, signed artifacts, the release's manifests, clean installation, 0.x
   upgrade behavior, and every reported application/protocol version.

After `1.0.0`, breaking changes increment major, features increment minor, and
improvements and fixes increment patch. Add supported release branches only if
the project later commits to maintaining multiple release lines.

## Required repository settings

Keep squash merge as the only merge method and set its defaults to **Pull
request title** and **Pull request body**.

A branch ruleset on `main` requires the individual CI jobs, not an aggregate
wrapper — there is none. The required contexts are `change scope`, `semantic PR
title`, `release policy`, `secret scan (gitleaks)`, `supply-chain advisories
(cargo-deny)`, `unused deps (cargo-machete)`, `third-party notices`, `rustfmt`,
`clippy`, `desktop test`, `Windows cargo check`, `test`, `postgres state
machine`, and `desktop UI`, each pinned to the GitHub Actions app (`app_id`
15368) so no other app can satisfy them.
Every lane a change's scope can reach runs on the pull request itself; a lane
outside the scope reports a successful skip, which is what lets a required
check pass without running. Green PR checks cover the scoped Linux lanes plus
Windows compilation for every Rust-scoped change, re-backed by the same lanes
on every Rust-scoped push to `main` and on the weekly scheduled run. Keep the
whole set required so the skip-reporting stays wired up, and add any new
always-running lane to the list.

The `semantic version label` check from the release-draft workflow stays
non-required: the required `semantic PR title` job already fails unless the
managed release labels match the title, so requiring the label job too would
add nothing.

Two scoped lanes are not required yet. `macOS desktop` runs clippy and the
desktop test subset on macOS for every Rust-scoped change, because no other
pull request lane compiles the desktop's macOS-only code. `Storybook
accessibility` runs axe, through the Storybook a11y addon, over every built
story for every UI change, and fails on critical and serious violations that
`crates/tidebreak-desktop/ui/scripts/storybook-a11y-allowlist.mjs` does not
name. To require either lane, add its name to the `main` ruleset's required
status checks, pinned to the GitHub Actions app, and to the list above.

`Windows cargo check` is rust-scoped like clippy because a Windows compile
break on `main` blocks the desktop release. It typechecks the installer graph
on `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`: `tidebreak-desktop` plus the `tidebreak-cli` and
`tidebreak-host-broker` sidecars. It does not run native Windows tests.

Every workflow runs on GitHub's standard hosted runners (`ubuntu-latest`,
`ubuntu-22.04`, the ARM64 Ubuntu and Windows images, `macos-latest`, and
`windows-latest`), which are free for public repositories. Larger runners are
billed, so no workflow selects one. Windows ARM64 stays on the native
`windows-11-arm` runner required by decision 43.

The release-draft workflow uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`; it does not require
a personal access token or a GitHub App. It drafts the next version from the
latest published release, so it refuses to run while version tags exist but no
release is published: publish a baseline release for the newest version tag
before the first draft.

Also set these once:

- **Pages:** set the source to **GitHub Actions** so the **Publish
  documentation** workflow can deploy.
- **Releases:** turn on release immutability, so a published release's tag and
  assets cannot change.
- **Security:** turn on private vulnerability reporting, which `SECURITY.md`
  sends reporters to.
